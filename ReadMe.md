# 📧 Email to Task Automation (Activepieces Flow)

This repository contains a no-code/low-code automation built with [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/) that turns incoming **Gmail emails into structured Notion tasks** using **Cohere AI** for natural language understanding.

---

## 💡 What It Does

Whenever a new email arrives in your Gmail inbox:

1. ✅ Activepieces triggers the flow
2. 🧠 The email content is sent to **Cohere AI** to extract a task description, due date, and priority
3. 🗃 The task is saved as a new row in a **Notion database**

---

### ✅ Example

**Email:**
> Subject: Client Follow-up  
> Body: "Don't forget to schedule a call with the client next Monday."

**Becomes this Notion task:**
```json
{
  "task": "Schedule a call with the client",
  "dueDate": "2025-05-26",
  "priority": "High"
}
